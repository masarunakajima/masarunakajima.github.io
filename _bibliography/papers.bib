  abstract={Saskatchewan Torus-Modified (STOR-M) is a small tokamak, 
  well known for various fusion-related basic experimental studies such as edge turbulent 
  heating, different instabilities, Alternating Current (AC) tokamak operation, 
  Ohmic H-mode triggering by the electrode biasing, fueling and momentum injection by 
  Compact Torus (CT) injection, and the effects of Resonance Magnetic Perturbations 
  (RMPs), among others. Some of those experiments require real-time visualization of 
  magnetic surface reconstructions either through EFIT or quick analyses and visualization 
  of experimental data during experiments. Recently, experimental studies of Geodesic 
  Acoustic Mode (GAM) and zonal flows were performed in the STOR-M tokamak. 
  The GAM experiments strongly require the collection of fluctuation data from 
  different Langmuir probes installed at different poloidal locations, but on 
  the same magnetic surfaces. This is requires the adjustment of radial locations
   between discharges. It is therefore important to analyze and visualize the features 
   of all probe data quickly during discharges. For this purpose, a Python code was 
   developed and used for quick analysis of the data. This article describes the 
   development of the code using Python and its use in detail.}

  abstract={STOR-M is an iron-core, limiter based tokamak with major and minor radii of 46cm 
  and 12 cm, respectively. Recently, electrode biasing experiments have been carried to study 
  the improved confinement. For this purpose we have developed a DC power supply which can be 
  gated by a high power SCR. The rectangular SS electrode has a height of 10 cm, a width of 
  2 cm and a thickness of 0.2 cm. The radial position of the electrode throughout the
   experiments is kept around 4mm inside the limiter in the plasma edge region. After 
   application of positive bias with voltages between +90 V to +110 V during the plasma 
   discharge current flat top with slightly higher edge-qa (nearly 5 to 6), noticeable 
   increment of average plasma density and soft x-ray intensity along the central chord
    have been observed. No distinguishable change in H α emission has been measured. 
    These phenomena may be attributed to improved confinement formed at the inner region 
    but not at the edge. In the upcoming experimental campaign, Ion Doppler spectroscopy
     will be used to measure possible velocity shear inside the inner plasma region. 
     Edge plasma pressure gradient will also be measured using Langmuir probes. 
     Detailed experimental results will be presented.}

  of Langmuir probe as well as poloidal and toroidal mode numbers (m  =  1,n  =  0)

  The dispersion relation of the mode is also similar to GAM and it also shows collisional

  GAM-like mode does not show similar symmetric poloidal and toroidal mode numbers 
  (m  =  0,n  =  0), but has (m  =  1,n  =  1). 
  The GAM-like mode has also a pronounced magnetic component with mixed poloidal modes 
  ($m=3~{\rm and}~m=5; n=1$ ), as observed by Mirnov coils. This mode is suppressed by 
  the application of resonance magnetic perturbations.}

  abstract={A pulsed oscillating power amplifier has been developed to apply high frequency 
  biasing voltage to an electrode at the edge of the STOR-M tokamak plasma. The power amplifier 
  can deliver a peak-to-peak oscillating voltage ±60 V and current 30 A within the frequency 
  range 1 kHz–50 kHz. The electrode is located in the equatorial plane at radius $\rho \ = 0.88$. 
  The frequency of the applied voltage has been varied between discharges. 
  It is observed that the plasma density and soft x-ray intensity from the plasma core 
  region usually increase at lower frequency regime 1 kHz–5 kHz as well as relatively 
  higher frequency regime 20 kHz–25 kHz but seldom increase in between them. 
  Increment of $\tau$ \ has been observed 40% and 20% for the frequency regimes of 1 kHz–5 kHz 
  and 20 kHz–25 kHz, respectively, and $\tau$ increment is 25% for both frequency regimes. 
  Transport simulation has been carried out using the ASTRA simulation code for STOR-M 
  tokamak parameters to understand the physical process behind experimental observations 
  at the higher frequency branch. The model is based on geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) 
  excitement at resonance frequency associated with Ware-pinch due to the oscillating 
  electric field produced by biasing voltage, which can suppress anomalous transport. 
  Simulation results reproduce the experimental trends quite well in terms of the density, 
  particle confinement, as well as energy confinement time evolution. All the results indicate 
  that high frequency biasing is capable of improving confinement efficiently.}

  active topic in fusion energy research. RMP involves the use of radial magnetic fields 
  generated by external coils installed on a tokamak device. The resonant interaction between 
  the plasma and the RMP field has many favorable effects such as suppression of instabilities
  and, under certain conditions, improvement of discharge parameters in tokamaks. 
  The RMP technique has been successfully implemented in the STOR-M tokamak. 
  A set of (m = 2, n = 1) helical coils carrying a current pulse was used to study the 
  effects of RMP on magnetic islands, plasma rotation, and other edge plasma parameters.
  A new RMP system is being developed for the STOR-M tokamak. The system consists of a 
  number of external saddle coils distributed in the poloidal and toroidal directions and 
  powered by AC power supplies to generate a rotating RMP field. Numerical simulations have 
  been carried out to calculate several parameters for the new RMP system such as the magnetic 
  field and the dominant modes generated by the coils. The dominant mode generated by the new 
  RMP coil system may be tuned to (2, 1) with significant contributions from (2, 3) and (2, 5)

  This oscillator is capable of providing a peak to peak oscillating output voltage of

  distortions. The overall output power is amplified by a two-stage metal oxide semiconductor 
  field-effect transistor power op-amp as well as nine identical push–pull amplifiers in the 
  final stages. The power amplifier input signal, collected from the plasma floating potential 
  during the tokamak discharge, is optically isolated from the tokamak vessel ground. 
  The filtered floating potential fluctuations with a band width of 5 kHz–40 kHz were 
  amplified and fed to an electrode inserted into the plasma edge to study the response 
  of the plasma turbulence. We observe that magnetic fluctuations are suppressed due to 
  real time feedback of the floating potential.}

  three Langmuir probe sets are located in the same toroidal plane, inserted from top, bottom 
  and outboard of the mid-plane. The fourth set is inserted from the outboard of the mid-plane,
   but toroidally separated from the others by 90°. Each probe set consists of three Langmuir
    probe tips for Isat, floating potential and I-V curve measurements. Preliminary 
    experimental results with slightly higher edge-qa (within 5 to 6) clearly indicate a 
    180° phase difference between the up and down density fluctuation signals near 20 kHz. 
    The floating potential fluctuation signals from the same locations at the same frequency 
    showed no observable phase shift. Preliminary data indicate the presence of conventional
     GAM in STOR-M. In the near future, magnetic fluctuation properties of GAM oscillations 
     in STOR-M as well as the responses of the GAM properties to electrode biasing will be
      studied. Detailed experimental results will be presented.}

  abstract={In this experimental study, we used a set of Langmuir probes in order to observe 
  geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) in plasmas created in the STOR-M tokamak. At four locations of 
  STOR-M, we measured floating potential and ion saturation current. Around 9 ms into the
   discharge, the end of ramp-up region and the beginning of the flat-top region, we found 
   a dominant peak around 30 kHz in the power spectral densities of ion saturation current.
   The ion saturation current signals showed the sine theta dependence of the oscillation 
   amplitude, which is one of the characteristics of GAM. Furthermore, the cross spectral 
   analysis on the ion saturation current signals suggested the poloidal mode number of 
   m = 1. As for the floating potential signals, while 30 kHz peak was present around 9 ms, 
   the cross spectral analysis indicated the poloidal mode number of m = 1, which is not 
   expected for GAM. In comparison to the theoretical calculations of GAM frequency, 
   the frequency predicted by the fluid model matched with the experimental results. 
   Based on the above findings, it is concluded that the plasmas in the STOR-M tokamak 
   have a signature of GAM.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
