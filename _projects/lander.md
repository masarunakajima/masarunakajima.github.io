# lander - Land sales analysis app

This is a user interface app for querying and analyzing real estate properties,
especially lands, in the US. To use this app, the user needs an account at 
[Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/hub). 

## How it works
This application queries land sales data from [Zillow](https://rapidapi.com/s.mahmoud97/api/zillow56) and saves to the local SQLite database.
The saved data is used for analysis.
